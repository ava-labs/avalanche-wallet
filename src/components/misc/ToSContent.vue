            expedited procedures in those rules) (the “JAMS Rules”), except as modified by this
            Dispute Resolution section. In the event of a conflict between the JAMS Rules and this

            countervailing law, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The arbitrator’s award of

            below as to the types and amounts of damages for which a Party may be held liable. The
            arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and
            only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual
            claim. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available

            fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the JAMS Rules, or in
            accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the JAMS Rules. However, if the value
            of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing,
            administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the

            frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth
            in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In such circumstances, fees will be
            determined in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its
            own attorneys&#39; fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the
            right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the

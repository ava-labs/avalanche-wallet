                arbitrator experienced in the software industry who is jointly selected and mutually
                approved by you and us or, if you and we are unable to or fail to agree on the
                selection of the arbitrator within 15 days of the demand for arbitration being
                served, who is appointed by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) in
                accordance with its rules. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to
                the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (and in accordance with the
                expedited procedures in those rules) (the &ldquo;JAMS Rules&rdquo;), except as
                modified by this Dispute Resolution section. In the event of a conflict between the
                JAMS Rules and this Dispute Resolution section, this Dispute Resolution section
                shall control, subject to countervailing law, unless the parties agree otherwise.
                The arbitrator&rsquo;s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the
                &ldquo;Limitations of Liability&rdquo; section below as to the types and amounts of
                damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory
                or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary
                to provide relief warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim. The JAMS Rules

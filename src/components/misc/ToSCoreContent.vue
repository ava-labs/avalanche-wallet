            The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute

            you and us or, if you and we are unable to or fail to agree on the selection of the
            arbitrator within 15 days of the demand for arbitration being served, who is appointed
            by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) in accordance with its rules. The
            arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration
            Rules and Procedures (and in accordance with the expedited procedures in those rules)
            (the “JAMS Rules”), except as modified by this Dispute Resolution section. In the event

            which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
            relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
            warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to

            fully understand the nature of the transaction you are entering into and the extent of
            your exposure to loss.
